# Put ignore patterns for build artifacts above the cut line

# This file contains .gitignore rules that are often used with Drupal projects.
# Because .gitignore is specific to your site and its deployment processes, you
# may need to uncomment, add, or remove rules.

# Ignore custom modules managed by Composer.
#
# When a development team creates one or more custom modules that
# are intended for use on more than one site, the typical strategy
# is to register them in Packagist and give them the type
# `drupal-custom-module` instead of `drupal-module`. This will cause
# Composer to install them to the directory `modules/custom`.
# This will cause a build error on Pantheon unless this location
# is .gitignore'd as shown below.
#
# An alternate strategy for custom modules is to commit them
# directly to the repository of the site where they are used. This
# is commonly done with modules that are specific to just one site.
#
# Sites that have both Composer-managed custom modules and custom
# modules that are committed directly to the repository may ignore
# the `modules/custom` directory with the first rule shown below,
# and then allow the locations to be committed on a case-by-case
# basis by re-adding paths using `!` rules. A path that begins with
# a `!` will allow a previously-ignored path to be added to the
# repository. Note, however, that a path cannot be re-added if any
# of its parent directories are excluded. This is why we use the
# rule `/modules/custom/*` instead of `/modules/custom`. Alternately,
# you might instead commit Git-tracked custom modules to some other
# path, such as /web/modules/<site-namespace>.
#
# Sites that do not have any Composer-managed custom modules do
# not need to use any of the `modules/custom` rules below.

# Generally you should only ignore the root vendor directory. It's important

# custom module, theme, etc., are not ignored unless you purposely do so.

# Ignore other scaffold files

# Ignore all files placed directly at the project root. Rely on
# .gitignore files placed by drupal/core-composer-scaffold to avoid
# build errors that arise if non-ignored files are scaffolded.
