description: 'Note: Next steps cards override the default Next steps cards (Learn more about our programs, Apply to program, and Visit our campus) from left to right. A total of three cards will always display. You can add up to three overrides. If you only want to override the final card, an easy way to do this is to add three cards, but only provide title overrides for the first two - which could be their original titles. The default content will be used for the first two.'
