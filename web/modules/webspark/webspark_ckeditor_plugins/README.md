# Webspark ckeditor plugins module

## Description

Webspark ckeditor plugins module comes with a number of plugins for the ckeditor that
add or alter the functionalities of the rich text editor when creating new
content.

TODO: Currently the Webspark CKEditor Plugins module supports CKEditor 4 and 5 versions
of plugins. When we move to Drupal 10, the CKEditor 4 plugins can be removed, and this
README can be updated to be version 5 specific. The document linked in the section
below will be helpful in distinguishing between the 4 versions of plugins when it is
time to clean up.

## CKEditor 5 Plugins

Architecture of CKEditor 4 and 5 plugins are described in the
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gRWqWQ4xy_V_GUUIX2zs903IG7Ku0pP6A4YAf17BXkU/edit
document from the WS2-1452 effort.

The purpose of each of our version 5 plugins is identical to the verion 4 instances,
though the details below may vary some.
